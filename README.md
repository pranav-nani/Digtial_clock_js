A digital clock using JavaScript is a small program that displays the current time in a digital format on a web page. It uses JavaScript to retrieve the current time from the user's device and updates the clock in real-time. The digital clock typically includes hours, minutes, and seconds, and may also display the date. It provides a simple and convenient way for users to keep track of time while browsing the web.
